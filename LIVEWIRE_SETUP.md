# Livewire Installation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What was installed:

1. **Livewire 3.6.4** - The latest version compatible with Laravel 10
2. **Configuration files** - Published to `config/livewire.php`
3. **Assets** - Published to `public/vendor/livewire/`
4. **Layout integration** - Added `@livewireStyles` and `@livewireScripts` to both layout files

## Test the Installation:

1. Start your Laravel development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/livewire-test` (after logging in)

3. You should see a test component with a counter button that works without page refresh!

## How to create new Livewire components:

### Method 1: Using Artisan (Recommended)
```bash
php artisan make:livewire StudentList
```

### Method 2: Manual creation
1. Create component class: `app/Livewire/StudentList.php`
2. Create view file: `resources/views/livewire/student-list.blade.php`

## Example Component Structure:

```php
<?php
// app/Livewire/StudentList.php
namespace App\Livewire;

use Livewire\Component;
use App\Models\Student;

class StudentList extends Component
{
    public $search = '';
    public $students;

    public function mount()
    {
        $this->students = Student::all();
    }

    public function updatedSearch()
    {
        $this->students = Student::where('name', 'like', '%' . $this->search . '%')->get();
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.student-list');
    }
}
```

```blade
{{-- resources/views/livewire/student-list.blade.php --}}
<div>
    <input wire:model.live="search" type="text" placeholder="Search students...">
    
    <div class="mt-4">
        @foreach($students as $student)
            <div class="p-3 border rounded mb-2">
                {{ $student->name }} - {{ $student->grade }}
            </div>
        @endforeach
    </div>
</div>
```

## Using components in your views:

```blade
@livewire('student-list')
```
